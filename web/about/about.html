            At RHEMA, we believe that every Christian has a calling to serve in
            the Kingdom of God. RHEMA was founded in 1975 to train and equip
            Christians to fulfill the call of God upon their lives. RHEMA is
            present in 48 countries with over 40,000 graduates worldwide.
            <br /><br />
            Birthed in 2001, RHEMA Singapore began with a mandate to impact all
            of Asia with the message of faith. We exist to impart the Word of
            God to our students in Singapore, and to teach them how to move in
            the Spirit with God's anointing.
            <br /><br />
            As a student of RHEMA Singapore, you will discover what your gifts
            and calling are, how you can lead a successful Christian life, and
            how you can practically serve God. Our curriculum is designed to be
            spiritually transforming and practical in application, thereby
            equipping you for the purpose which the Lord has for you!

                  since 1994, first in the nation of Estonia, and since 2002 in
                  Singapore. They have a passion to see Christians rise to their
                  full potential in Christ, live a successful Christian life,
                  and be equipped to fulfill their calling from the Lord.

                  Cindy have traveled extensively, ministering in Bible schools,
                  churches, leadership seminars, and evangelistic crusades in 17
                  nations.

              The mandate, "Go teach My people faith", was given by God to
              Kenneth E. Hagin, the founder of Rhema Bible Training College.
              Today his son, Kenneth W. Hagin, the school's president, and his
              daughter-in-law, Lynette Hagin, it's director, carry out the
              mandate. And this mandate is cascaded throughout the worldwide
              Rhema family.
